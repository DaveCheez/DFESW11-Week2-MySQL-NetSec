I reccomend EVERYONE stores commands in some kind of text 

If using apple the default notes software adds weird characters

Within MySQL all command words should be upper case 

MySQL - Semantic, word focused commands

How to create a database

create database <name of database>;

How to tell MySQL to use this database

USE <db name>


Making our table

name of table: Pizzas

Toppings       - varchar(30)
Size	       - tinyInt
StuffedCrust - boolean 

Either going to have a stuffedCrust or not

before we can run this command, we need to tell mysql to use our pizzeria database

CREATE TABLE pizzas (
toppings VARCHAR(30), 
size TINYINT,
stuffedCrust BOOLEAN
);

See what headings are in a table:
DESCRIBE <table name>
